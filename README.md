GameShell skins begins at hashtag  [#acb6774](https://github.com/clockworkpi/launcher/commit/acb6774495a5c61b845b997e8822930a39f6b509) of the [Launcher](https://github.com/clockworkpi/launcher)

Put the skin folder under 

`/home/cpi/skins/`

Launcher will scan over it ,shows up in `Settings` Menu 






PS:  
In the process of developing skin, launcher will not start if there is no font file  
and if there are no resource png for the title bar and bottom bar, launcher will not start neither  
so the skin development can be carried out on PC to ensure that all resource pictures are available as far as possible.
